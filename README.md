## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

In this project, I optimized two pages:
* Optimizations made to views/js/main.js make views/pizza.html render with a consistent frame-rate at 60fps when scrolling.
* index.html achieves a PageSpeed score of at least 90 for Mobile and Desktop.

## Optimizations
* Refactored Javascript to prevent layout thrashing
* Resized images in Photoshop
* Optimized images with Gulp
* Minified HTML and Javascript with Gulp
* Inlined CSS


## Build Tools
I used Gulp for minification and image optimization. The configuration files are:
- gulfile.js
- package.json
